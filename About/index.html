			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<h3>Here are some things about me.</h3>
			<p>Through my academic studies, work experience and campus involvement, I have been able to develop my communication, analytical, quantitative, and technical skills. My studies at OU have prepared to use Python, SAP, and SQL coding in real-world instances.  I have a demonstrated ability to work as a key part of a team or to work independently in a fast-paced environment.  As an IT Consultant I had the opportunity to work with a diverse clientele to assess their needs and offer recommendations.  Additionally, I was responsible for creating client ready deliverables and assessing financial planning strategies.  As the Wish Week Chair for my sorority, I work with a team of seven members to plan and organize fundraising events for Make A Wish.  Additionally, I have the responsibility for verifying and disbursing incoming funds for the event.  I know that my work ethic and attention to detail, combined with these skills, make me an ideal candidate for any position.</p>
