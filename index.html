	<p>Hello! Currently, I am enrolled as BBA/MAcc student at the University of Oklahoma. My studies have led me to pursue a double major in Accounting and Management Information Systems. and pursing a Master's in Accountancy. I am hoping that I might gain real work experience and further my knowledge of accounting and technology. My goal after graduation is to pass all four sections of the CPA exam.</p>
